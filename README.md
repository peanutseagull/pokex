# PokéX
This is my attempt to recreate Pokemon X within the Pokemon Crystal engine.

## Credit
This project is *heavily* reliant on the [**pokecrystal**](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal) project -- specifically the newbox branch.
Pokemon sprites sourced from the Pokemon Essentials GSC Kit by Xaveriux. 
Credit to the sprite creators (there were no names on the page for gen 6 sprites I'm sorry)
